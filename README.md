# DataMining
The project aims at solving a real-world Machine Learning task on a large dataset. This challenge consists of classifying drawings of plants into a large number of categories. This is therefore an image classification task, something that is quite easy to solve using widely-available neural networks.The Resnet18 model was trained on the dataset, and was used in prediction mode. 
Due to the size of the data set is a challenge, it is suitable for big data course. The training procedure is distributed and parallelized. Several machines were used to make the training faster using MPI and GPU.
